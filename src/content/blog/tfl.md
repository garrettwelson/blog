What can be said, really, about such an iconic restaurant. We arrived after a luxurious an indulgent day gearing up for my birthday.

## The Morning

Awoke late and was banished to stay in the bedroom while Becca prepared me breakfast. It was stunningly good: a feast consisting of a French omelet with Jasper Hill cheese and caviar, high quality bacon, avocado toast, fresh fruit, and homemade Danishes. Not to mention hand-squeezed orange juice and mimosas.

I mean come on. How did I get so lucky

Packing was rushed and stressful, but mercifully that meant it was over quickly. After a scenic drive we arrived at the Bardessono.

## The Hotel

We arrived and our bags were whisked away and the front desk ushered us back to the spa where we had booked an 80-minute couple’s massage. We got to enjoy separate changing rooms with spa water, saunas, all manner of high-end grooming products, and showers.

The massage was excellent - easily the best one I’ve had. Oddly, the electricity went out midway through but our therapists barely batted an eye and kept going by the light of an emergency lantern they turned on in the room. The rest of the massage was carried out in silence (without the typical massage background soundtrack) and by a flickering lantern, but that somewhat enhanced the ambiance.

We were brought to our suite after the massage wrapped up and our luggage was brought dutifully right behind us. The power was still out but came back on midway through our tour. The suite was incredibly indulgent: a huge Jacuzzi tub, a steam shower, a private patio, a FIREPLACE, two huge TVs, a living/dining room, the list goes on...Most of all it is SO PRIVATE, with no neighbors above or on any side - just a freestanding building.

After some pool time and a steam shower, we got ready for dinner

## The Dinner

The experience began as soon as the BMW pulled up to drive us (all of three minutes) to the hotel. It was one of those cars that’s built around the back seat, which I had never really experienced before. It was huge and spacious and comfortable.

We were quickly ushered back to our table and made our first critical mistake: we didn’t pick up our napkins for the first 30 minutes or so. They kept bringing us delightful champagne, but no food. Confused and wondering if they were waiting for some signal, I put the napkin in my lap and almost immediately the feast began.

It’s really impossible to choose a dish that was the “best” - it was all incredible. Some standouts from the experience were:

- The tomato soup - surprisingly delicious and refreshing. The celery flavor exploded out of it
- Getting to choose from a tray of ornate sake glasses for our pairing
- The “Oysters and Pearls” - a classic for a reason and truly incredible
- Learning that apparently foie gras is illegal in California - who knew!
- Enjoying a nearly comical amount of black truffles shaved onto our Mac and cheese and learning that as of a few days ago they were fresh from Australia as opposed to the frozen and preserved ones used throughout the wine and spring
- Having Wagyu as a tartare (and bacon!?!?) instead of the main dish was a brilliant move
- Having lamb be the star of the show was bold and clever and I think unique to our menu. It was among the best bites of food I’ve ever had
- We love a post-entree, pre-dessert cheese course
- Dessert was absolutely comical but amazing - I could eat nothing but those donuts for the rest of my life and be happy
- Ending with a tour of the kitchen was thrilling

We took plenty of breaks and walks around the garden. On the first one, we saw an older man in a chef’s coat standing on the grass. He said hello and asked if we were celebrating anything. I asked him if he works in the kitchen and he laughed and said “no, I just dress like it”. To my horror, I realized afterwards it was none other than Chef Keller himself, but he was gracious (and honestly possibly relieved to encounter two people there not fawning over him) and invited us to explore the garden saying “enjoy, it’s yours for tonight”. As we walked away, he was happily photographing the North Star using his phone.

## Turning 30

Apart from waking up with a hangover, my first full day as a 30 year old feels pretty great so far. I decided to take care of my body with a long, luxurious bath and shaving my chest, something I’ve meant to do for months.
