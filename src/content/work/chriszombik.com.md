Built a small static website for my friend Chris Zombik, who is a fantasy author with a forthcoming debut novel. Chris wanted a simple, minimal website to serve as a landing/contact page and to feature a few blog posts and short fiction works. 

Site was built using Astro with Tailwind for styling.
