My journey into the tech industry officially began in 2019 when I enrolled in Hack Reactor, a coding bootcamp in Austin, Texas. From there, I was fortunate to be accepted as a REACH Apprentice Software Engineer at LinkedIn. I worked as an Apprentice for approximately one year, at which point I was promoted to a Software Engineer and then subseuqently promoted to my current role as a Senior Engineer a year and a half later.  My work centers on LinkedIn's main feed, where I work on a talented team of client and API engineers and help build accessible, delightful user experiences.

I had developed an interest in tech as a young child which grew over time. As a student at Williams College, I majored in Political Science but in the spirit of liberal arts took classes in history, Spanish, literature, art history, mathematics, and more. In my senior year, I took an introductory class in Computer Science. The curriculum focused on Python with a focus on working with data. I carried this knowledge of scripting and data analysis into my first job as a Business Analyst at a small Vermont-based EdTech startup. This gave me an opportunity to write code to process vendor data and create internal dashboards. This encouraged me to learn more, prompting me to enroll in Hack Reactor.
